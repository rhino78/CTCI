# 2.5 sum lists
# you have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains  a single digit.
# The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
# write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
# example:
# (7-1-6) + (5-9-2) thats 617+ 295
# Output 2-1-9 that's 912
